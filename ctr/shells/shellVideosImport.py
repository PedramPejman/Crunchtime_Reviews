videos1 =[(1,'APMA1110',8,1,'Arc Length','We can compute the length of a curve by breaking it up into pieces until the pieces are essentially straight lines. Then we can compute the length of each line and add them all up in order to calculate the total length of the curve.','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld5NTde2dOs'),(2,'APMA1110',8,2,'Fluid Pressure','One of the applications we will study is modeling fluid pressure and force. This is done by realizing that the force that a fluid exerts on an object is dependent on 1) a constant factor 2) the cross section area of the object and 3) the depth of the cross section. Let\'s see how it works.','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVNFRZ0HjzI'),(3,'APMA1110',8,3,'Center of Mass','We can use calculus to find the center of mass of an object bounded by mathematical functions. The approach is to first find the moments of the object about the y and x axis. Then, we divide the moments respectively by the mass of the object and obtain the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the center of mass of the object.','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRc7Cvz2OJU'),(8,'APMA1110',7,1,'Integration By Parts - Tabular Method','Integration by parts can be somewhat simplified by resorting to the tabular method. This method makes application of multiple integration by parts much more efficient. So whenever we expect that we will have to integrate by parts more than once, it makes sense to go ahead and set up the tabular method.','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS2Kdc4O9Vs'),(9,'APMA1110',7,1,'Integration By Parts - Inverse Trig','The most important decision when integrating by parts is which function to derive and which to integrate. Whenever presented with an integrand that contains an inverse trig function, we immediately know that it is the function that we will derive (simply because we don\'t really know how to integrate them..).','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFwhTXlQg-M'),(10,'APMA1110',7,2,'Trig Integrals - Part 1','Whenever presented with integrals containing sines and cosines, we try to separate the two functions, and end up with some complicated expression containing only one of them, and then the other multiplied by dx. Then using a u-substitution, we will get rid of both sin and cosine and end up with a polynomial integrand.','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwPwrl4eOjA'),(11,'APMA1110',7,2,'Trig Integrals - Part 2','Very similar to the previous video, our treatment of integrals containing tangents and secants will consist of separating them, \"cornering\" one function (by stripping it of its power - literally), and then using a u-substitution to get rid of both functions.','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUfA6r_pxqA'),(12,'APMA1110',7,3,'Trig Substitution','Sometimes, when presented with integrals of the three forms shown in the video, we have the chance to introduce trigonometric functions in order to rewrite the integrand as a derivative of a known inverse trig function (tangent or sine). This is a fairly long process, so we have to have our wits about us!','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_wK58DHgG4'),(13,'APMA1110',7,5,'Partial Fractions Decomposition','Partial fractions decomposition is a technique used when we are faced with a complicated fraction and wish to decompose it into simpler fractions. Using this technique, we can integrate very complex rational functions (first by breaking them up into smaller fractions and then integrating those simpler fractions).','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2njH400SEg'),(14,'APMA1110',7,6,'Improper Integrals','Whenever infinities show up in our integrals, we must take special care. Let\'s explore the two prominent cases where this happens: Infinite bounds, and discontinuous integrands. ','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOO3s_NGlQc'),(15,'APMA1110',7,7,'Probability','Using a PDF (Probability Distribution Function) we can model how frequently things happen. This example is the interval between each time we blink. Using the model, we can ask questions like, \"How likely is it that I will wait 2 to 6 seconds to blink again?\" ','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83RfsKObKQc'),(16,'APMA1110',6,5,'Work','A force is said to do work when acting on a body there is a displacement of the point of application in the direction of the force. When we have a force that is not constant over our desired interval, we have to use integration to figure out the work done by the force, on an object.','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJghcjutGZA'),(17,'APMA1110',6,4,'Cylindrical Shells - Part 1','By choosing cross sections to be parallel to the axis of rotation, we can divide our region up into cylinders. Then, we calculate the surface area of each cylinder and add them all up in order to get the volume generated by the whole region when rotated about the axis of rotation. ','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0bfPV7qaF4'),(18,'APMA1110',6,4,'Cylindrical Shells - Part 2','Let\'s work out a couple of examples of the method of cylindrical shells. First example requires us to write an integral in terms of y. The second example allows us to gain exposure to rotate the cross sections about an axis that is not aligned with either the x or the y axis. ','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JwOXYX0y-M'),(19,'APMA1110',7,1,'Integration By Parts - Repeating','Sometimes, we are faced with integrals containing a trig function and an exponential (or a similar structure). Here, no matter how many times we differentiate either function, they will not go to zero. But we notice that if we differentiate the trig function twice, it comes back to a constant multiplied by itself. We will use this fact to create an equation involving the integral and solve for its value. Let\'s see how it works.\r\n','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wc5i6e0S-IE')]
videos2 =[(1,'APMA2120',2,2,'Dot Product','The dot product, or the inner product, is one of the building blocks of spatial geometry. Aside from its more important consequences in abstract algebra, the dot product allows us to find components of vector A that is in the same direction of vector B. Think about how useful that could prove to be...','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfFt__T69bc'),(2,'APMA2120',2,1,'Representing A Line','We learned about representing lines and points in 2-D in algebra. It turns out, by adding another degree of freedom, the z-coordinate, we need to be more careful about how we define lines. In 3-d , a line can be represented in a verity of ways, two of which are shown in this video.','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfMtEi4r-R0'),(3,'APMA2120',2,3,'Cross Product','The cross product of 2 vectors, unlike their dot product, is a vector itself! The cross product, or the outer product, is also one of the building blocks of spatial geometry. Aside from its uses in abstract algebra, the cross product of 2 vectors has 2 important properties: 1) it is perpendicular to both vectors and 2) its magnitude is the area of the parallelogram constructed by the 2 vectors.','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_lYNh-gZHs'),(5,'APMA2120',2,5,'Quadric Surfaces','As if imagining curves in 2-d wasn\'t enough, now we are tasked with envisioning and drawing 3-dimensional surfaces. The easiest way to draw and envision quadric surfaces is to draw their 2-d projections onto the x-z, x-y, and y-z planes.','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkwrHkIZ2OU'),(6,'APMA2120',2,6,'Spherical Coordinates','The spherical coordinate system is ideal for representing spherical objects (surprise!!). It also works incredibly well when representing cone-like objects. Although it may seem a little weird and tricky at first (specially with all the trig functions floating around), it can make describing certain shapes much easier. ','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM5nnpQx-4I'),(7,'APMA2120',2,6,'Cylindrical Coordinates','Certain 3-D shapes are much easier to represent using a coordinate system other than our familiar cartesian ones. Cylindrical coordinate system is sort of the 3 dimension version of the polar coordinate system, namely the r, theta and a z slapped on the end. It is great for representing anything that resembles a cylinder. Let\'s take a look!','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rojHP3A-BmA'),(8,'APMA2120',3,2,'Arc Length','Just as we broke up 2-dimensional curves into tiny pieces - so tiny that they were basically straight lines, we can use the same methodology in order to compute the length of a 3-dimensional curve. However, now that we are aware of vector-valued functions, we can simplify the algebra. ','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7HOFaDAd0w'),(9,'APMA2120',3,1,'Vector-Valued Functions','You can think of vector valued functions as functions that spit back a bundle (instead of just a number). Furthermore, this bundle will usually take the (x,y) or (x,y,z) form and will have certain context along with it (e.g. a position, or a velocity vector). Think of how useful that could be: by inputing time into a function, you would get back a (x,y,z) bundle that tells you the position of an object. ','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiAonELlhKw'),(10,'APMA2120',3,2,'Arc-Length Reprameterization ','As you may remember, we said the difference between the \"path\" and the\"curve\" was the the curve was unique. It was the actual curve that existed in space - nothing to do with you. But the path of the curve is dependent on how you choose to parameterize it. So a curve has an infinite number of paths associated with it. The arc-length parameterization takes all that away. By using the variable \'s\' (related to the arc-length)  we eliminate any variation of parameter and thus create a unique \"path\" for our curve.','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbx0f-3ZT_k')]
videos3 =[(1,'APMA2130',2,1,'Integrating Factors','One of the easiest way to solve a linear differential equation is to multiply the whole equation by an integrating factor. This allows the left side to be a derivative of a product. Now our only requirement is going to be, \"Do we know how to integrate the new right side of the equation?\"','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auGkniVr_GE'),(2,'APMA2130',1,1,'Linear Differential Equations','We will start our discussion of differential equation with linear differential equations. This is because they are both widely encountered, and rather easy to solver (as we will see in the next video).','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtWcFKT1nkY'),(3,'APMA2130',1,2,'Second Order Equations','CORRECTION: Example 1. must be changed to y\'\' + 5y\' + 5 = 0. \r\n\r\nAlthough we are not yet equipped with the necessary knowledge to have a thorough discussion of second order equations, we will look at a couple special ones and notice patterns in their solutions. This will allow us to have an easier time dealing with them when we study them at length in the next unit. \r\n','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VQkM1H8tCU'),(4,'APMA2130',2,3,'Homogeneous Equations','Sometimes, when faced with a differential equation, the substitution v = y/x will make a huge contribution. This contribution is that if we can completely get rid of all occurrences of y/x, then the equation at hand will be linear in v and x. And we certainly know how to solve linear equations..','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7OScKO54Fo'),(5,'APMA2130',2,3,'Partial Fractions','Partial fractions decomposition is a technique used when we are faced with a complicated fraction and wish to decompose it into simpler fractions.

It models the amount of a solute in a mixture. If you set it up correctly, you will always end up with a linear equation, and an boundary condition. (Note, if you have 2 different intervals, you will haver 2 different equations and 2 boundary conditions).','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDAVqLag5hk'),(7,'APMA2130',2,4,'Bernoulli Equations','Bernoulli equations are those that are \"almost\" linear. Meaning they are linear equations except for one y raised to some power. If we can get rid of this y, then we have in our hands, a linear equation. So that\'s exactly what we\'ll do. Make a substitution, and get rid of the annoying y!','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgwdtsTJJLQ'),(8,'APMA2130',2,5,'Autonomous Equations','Autonomous equations are very important for modeling time-invariant systems. Our analysis of autonomous equations will usually be very typical.

By separable, we mean that we can separate all the terms containing x\'s and the dx term on one side of the equation, and all the ones containing y\'s on the other along with the dy. This will allow us to solve the equation by integrating both sides.','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbqigeN8TWU'),(10,'APMA2130',2,6,'Exact Equations - Part 1','It may take you a little bit of time to understand why we treat exact equations the way we do, or why they\'re important; that is ok - look at the process backwards (in other words, find the solution and then work back to the differential equation) and you might see the the pattern.','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtRY0BEwu8E'),(11,'APMA2130',2,6,'Exact Equations - Part 2','Since exact equations are very easy to solve, sometimes we look for ways to make equations that aren\'t exact, exact.
